# Breaking Bad info CLI 

I made this as my CLI project for FlatIron School. It is a simple, pure Ruby CLI application, that allows you to get information on episodes and characters from the TV show "Breaking Bad".


## Walkthrough
To start the program, type "ruby bin/start" in the terminal. 
Once you start the program, you will follow prompts by typing your reply into the terminal and pressing enter, Remember to make the first letter capital but if you do forget the program should rescue the error and continue running.
If you want to look for information on characters, you can enter the name of any character and you will get information on them.
If you are looking for episode information, you can search by the name of an episode that you know or type "list" to see a list of all the episode names in whichever season you choose. 
If you enter "No" when the program asks if youd like to look for something else, it will exit the program.
